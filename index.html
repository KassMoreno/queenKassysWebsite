                <p>Welcome to my very first 'hand-crafted' website! This website is 
                    meant to act as my portfolio and showcase my knowledge in web 
                    designing. Take a look around and see my progress!</p>

            <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
            <div class="aboutMe">                
                <p> With an eye for attention to detail, organization, and a love for
                    things that challenge me, coding has naturally caught my attention. I
                    live to learn and love to help, so I like to know a little about a lot
                    aside from my given focuses. I'm currently learning both cybersecurity
                    programming and software engineering. I am willing to try my hand at all
                    levels of complexity to learn and challenge myself. I am an Air Force
                    veteran with team/leadership experience from a wide range of backgrounds,
                    and while I work best in a team setting, I am fully capable of working
                    independently. Please, continue to see how far I've come in my career
                    transition!
