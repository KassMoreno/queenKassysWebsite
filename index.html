                <p>Welcome to my very first 'hand-crafted' website! This website is meant to act as my portfolio 
                    and showcase my knowledge. Take a look around and see my progress!</p>

                <p>With an eye for attention to detail, organization, and a love for things that challenge me,
                    coding has naturally caught my attention. I live to learn and love to help, so I like to know 
                    a little about a lot aside from my given focuses. I'm currently on track to earn a BA in Computer 
                    Information Systems (with a concentration in cybersecurity programming) with DeVry University. 
                    I am also attending Flatiron Bootcamp for software engineering. I am willing to try my hand at all 
                    levels of complexity to learn and challenge myself. I am an Air Force veteran with leadership 
                    experience, and while I work best in a team setting, I am fully capable of working independently 
                    as well. Please, continue to look through this site and see what I've learned through this journey.
