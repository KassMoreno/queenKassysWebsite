                <p>Welcome to my very first 'hand-crafted' website! This website is meant to act as my portfolio 
                    and showcase my knowledge in web designing. Take a look around and see my progress!</p>

            <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
            <div class="aboutMe">                
                <p>With an eye for attention to detail, organization, and a love<br>
                    for things that challenge me, coding has naturally caught my<br>
                    attention. I live to learn and love to help, so I like to know<br>
                    a little about a lot aside from my given focuses. I'm currently on<br>
                    track to earn a BA in Computer Information Systems,<br>
                    (concentrating on cybersecurity programming), with<br>
                    DeVry University. I am also attending a Flatiron<br>
                    Bootcamp for software engineering. I am willing to<br>
                    try my hand at all levels of complexity to<br>
                    learn and challenge myself. I am an Air Force<br>
                    veteran with leadership experience, and while I<br>
                    work best in a team setting, I am fully capable<br>
                    of working independently as well. Please,<br>
                    continue to look through this site and see<br>
                    what I've learned through this journey.
